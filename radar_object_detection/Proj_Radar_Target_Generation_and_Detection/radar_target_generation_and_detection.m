%% RANGE DOPPLER RESPONSE
% The 2D FFT implementation is already provided here. This will run a 2DFFT
% on the mixed signal (beat signal) output and generate a range doppler
% map.You will implement CFAR on the generated RDM


% Range Doppler Map Generation.

% The output of the 2D FFT is an image that has reponse in the range and
% doppler FFT bins. So, it is important to convert the axis from bin sizes
% to range and doppler based on their Max values.

Mix = reshape(Mix, [Nr, Nd]);

% 2D FFT using the FFT size for both dimensions.
sig_fft2 = fft2(Mix, Nr, Nd);

% Taking just one side of signal from Range dimension.

%dimensions

% Select the number of Guard Cells in both dimensions around the Cell under 
% test (CUT) for accurate estimation

G_doppler = 8;

% *%TODO* (done):
% Offset the threshold by SNR value in dB

% *%TODO* (done):
% Create a vector to store noise_level for each iteration on training cells
noise_level = zeros(1,1);


% *%TODO* :
% Design a loop such that it slides the CUT across range doppler map by
% giving margins at the edges for Training and Guard Cells.
% For every iteration sum the signal level within all the training
% cells. To sum convert the value from logarithmic to linear using db2pow
% function. Average the summed values for all of the training
% cells used. After averaging convert it back to logarithimic using pow2db.
% Further add the offset to it to determine the threshold. Next, compare the
% signal under CUT with this threshold. If the CUT level > threshold assign
% it a value of 1, else equate it to 0.
for i = 1 : 

   % Use RDM[x,y] as the matrix from the output of 2D FFT for implementing
   % CFAR





% *%TODO* :
% The process above will generate a thresholded block, which is smaller 
% than the Range Doppler Map as the CUT cannot be located at the edges of
% matrix. Hence,few cells will not be thresholded. To keep the map size same
% set those values to 0. 









% *%TODO* :
% Display the CFAR output using the Surf function like we did for Range
% Doppler Response output.
